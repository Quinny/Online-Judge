/*

On Privalov's first workday, Janus burdened Aldan with the task of four-dimensional convolution in the conjuration space. 
Aldan worked for a while, flashing its lights and rewinding tapes, then a fuse blew and the machine shut down. 
Well, replacing fuses is something even a programmer can do. But Janus is rather absent-minded, and he, being lost in thoughts about his convolution problem, forgot about the weak fuse next day. 
So, on a third day Janus launched his program again, blowing another fuse. 
The fourth day went calmly, but on a fifth day one more fuse had to be replaced. And Janus is still not going to give upâ€¦

Your task is to help Sasha in making the requisition for spare parts. 
The requsition is made for a specific period - from the A-th workday to the B-th workday inclusive. 
You should calculate, how many fuses Janus is going to blow with his programs in the specified period of time.
